🧠 About the Project

Tic Tac Toe (Python + Tkinter) is a classic two-player game reimagined with a clean graphical interface and an intelligent computer opponent.
You can play against another human locally or challenge an AI that uses the Minimax algorithm — ensuring perfect gameplay every time.

The game automatically resets after each round, providing an uninterrupted and enjoyable experience.

🚀 Features

✅ Two Game Modes

👥 2 Player Mode: Play locally with a friend.

🤖 Vs Computer Mode: Challenge an AI that never loses.

✅ Smart AI

Implements the Minimax algorithm to evaluate possible moves and choose the best outcome.

The AI adapts dynamically to player choices.

✅ Modern GUI

Built using Tkinter, Python’s built-in GUI library.

Dark-themed interface for a clean, professional look.

✅ Game Mechanics

Detects wins, draws, and invalid moves.

Automatically resets after each match.

Clear and interactive board layout.
